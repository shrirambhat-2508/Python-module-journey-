# Calendar Generator

A simple Python program that displays a calendar in the terminal using the built-in
calendar module.

The user can view either the full calendar of a year or a specific month.

## What it does

- Takes a year as input
- Shows the full year calendar or one month
- Starts the week from Sunday
- Handles invalid inputs
- Allows the user to restart or exit

## What I learned

- How to use Python’s calendar module
- How to take user input safely using try/except
- How to control program flow using loops
- How terminal formatting can differ between environments

## How to run

python calendar_generator.py

## Notes

- Uses only Python standard library
- Output formatting may vary depending on the terminal
